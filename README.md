# tausworthe_generator
This project implements a Tausworthe pseudo-random number generator and performs three statistical tests, specifically a goodness-of-fit-test, and two independence rets, to determine if the generator gives PRNs that are approximately independent and identically distributed with a distribution of uniform (0,1).
