# tausworthe_generator
This project implements a Tausworthe pseudo-random number generator and performs three statistical tests, specifically a goodness-of-fit-test, and two independence rets, to determine if the generator gives PRNs that are approximately independent and identically distributed with a distribution of uniform (0,1). We find that, yes, the Tausworthe Generator as programmed in the attached code file is able to generate reasonably independent and identically distributed uniform (0,1) observations if the values used to initiate the sequence of bits are chosen carefully. Specifically, values based on values of primitive, irreducible polynomials are found to most often produce pseudo-random numbers (PRNs) that pass statisical tests of goodness-of-fit and independence.
